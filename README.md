# Advanced-Library-Managment

Library management system is a project which aims in developing a computerized system to maintain all the daily work of library. 
This project has many features which are generally not available in normal library management systems like facility of admin login
through which the admin can monitor the whole system. The librarian after logging into his account can generate various option such 
as new student,new book, issue book and return book details. Overall this project of ours is being developed to help staff of library 
to maintain the library in the best way possible and also reduce the human efforts.

In this project there are mainly two modules
I.	User.
II.	Librarian.

The application should provide quick access to the records maintained and must reveal   the   important   reviews   about   the  
business   so   that   the   growth   can   be   easily compared and should provide with the various reports showing the related 
details so that the important decisions could be taken easily.

# Scope 

The main objective of the Library Management system is organizing and managing the library tasks. Library is place where all kind of books
are available. Only a registered user i.e. a librarian or borrower can access the application. Library Management system is developed 
to automate the task of entering the records of new book and retrieving the details of book available in the library.
This system
contains list of all the books. Using this system user can issue book to the library member, maintain their records, and can checks
how many book are issued and how many books are available in the library. This system provides separate interface and login for librarian, students and faculties.
Users can search for books in the application. In the proposed system, we assume that each member will be having a identity card and
a user ID which can be used for the library book issue, fine payment etc. 

Whenever library member wish to take a book, the book issued
by the library authority will be check both the book details as well as the borrower details and store it in library database. 
They can view the issue and return dates of any book.
This application can be used by any library system to automate the process.

The different areas where we can use this application are:
                
                •	Any education institution can make use of it for providing information about books borrowed, books available and keeping tracks of   date of issue and return.
              
              •	It can be used in offices and modifications can be done according to requirements.
